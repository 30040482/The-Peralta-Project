Following the September 2023 Board of Trustees meetings, The Peralta Project aims to turn the Peralta Community College District's “2%” budgetary issue into student homework assignments, exam questions, and tutoring exercises for Laney College's artificial intelligence and business administration courses.

This would allow students to analyze and fix the Peralta Community College District’s budgetary issues while recovering equity with every successful student project.

The project is conducted in four phases:

	Phase One: Direction and Organization.
 
	Phase One will require the allocation of assets and requisitions needed to execute the project. 
 	These assets include and are not limited to potential project directors and supervisors, data administrators and budget analysts, as well as extracurricular administrators.


	Phase Two: Data Analysis.
 
 	Phase two will have members from the PCCD provide the financial data required to execute the project. 
  	The integrity of the data will then be reviewed by members of the PFT, ASLC, ASBCC, ASMC, and ASCOA for a final approval by the Bias and Risk Mitigation Department in order to reinforce its accuracy and transparency.


	Phase Three: Bias and Risk Mitigation.
 
 	All approved datasets submitted by the PFT, ASLC, ASBCC, ASMC, and ASCOA would receive a final approval from the Bias and Risk Mitigation Department before being submitted to the Implementation and Application Department. 
  	The final approval from the Bias and Risk Mitigation Department must be motioned by the project directors in order to initiate the development of congruent data-frames extracted from TSV files that are used by PCCD spreadsheet applications.


	Phase Four: Implementation and Application.
 
  	TSV and CSV files provided to the Curriculum Development Team can then be integrated into the CIS-5 and CIS-96F coursework as a dataset that corresponds to PCCD-focused budgetary issues,
   	Allowing for student homework assignments and exams to serve as a platform for solutions to the PCCD’s current and future budgetary inquiries/scenarios in real time. 
    Developments, projects, and assignments that provide potential solutions can be further articulated by the Extracurricular Administration Team. With departments like the CIS Lab, BeeLikeCoders, and comAndCode, students can be recognized for their achievements as they recover equity for the PCCD in real time.
